   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;
    Colin Fotheringham
   </h3>
   <img src="proximity.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
   <p>
       Appleâ€™s webpage holds a lot of information about their various<br> products. With this example of proximity it shows how Apple<br> was able to organize their content in a way that would make <br>more sense to the user. Apple put each of the various content<br> under tabs that helps separate the information. Users are able<br> to quickly find and locate the information that they desire.
       </p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;
    Daniel Guzman
   </h3>
   <img src="main.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
   <p>
       The alignment Apple.com is great and organized. Everything that<br> is in their website is connected to each other and its about their<br> products. The first thing you see its their newest product which<br> is the Iphone 7 Product Red. The alignment is connected to each<br> other by different size of boxes. Their Menu bar contains all of their<br> products and support they offer.
       </p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;
       Mason Rowley
   </h3>
   <img src="repetition.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <p>
       The repetition that is used here can be seen in several different<br> elements. The first is the use of square shapes. The different kinds<br> of phones can be seen with in them. They are separated with a<br> smaller stripe of white to show where one product ends and another<br> begins. There is also repetition in the way the phones are lined up. <br>All the phones they sell are lined up the same way to show case size<br> and colors. There are also are lots colors being alternated between <br>light and dark all over the website.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;
   Blair Furner
   </h3>
   <img src="contrast.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
       The contrast in this image is very well done. The central image of the <br> watches stands out and is the first thing to catch your eye due to the <br>
       colors and unique design. Also it is very contrasted due to it being the <br> largest image on the page. The addition of the white and black contrast <br>
       adds a very simple but effective look.

   </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash;
    Vishal Peter
   </h3>
   <img src="typography.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
    The image explains the typography very well. As the big center<br> paragraph catches the attention of the people first and then the<br> explanotary one. The font size  well arranged. The other good<br> thing about this paragraph is the left handed arrangement of the<br> paragraph which keeps the reader focus.
