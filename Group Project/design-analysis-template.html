   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;
    Colin Fotheringham
   </h3>
   <img src="proximity.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
   <p><font size ="5">
       Appleâ€™s webpage holds a lot of information about their various products.<br> With this example of proximity it shows how Apple was able to organize<br> their content in a way that would make more sense to the user. Apple put <br>each of the various content under tabs that helps separate the information. <br>Users are able to quickly find and locate the information that they desire.
       </font></p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;
    Daniel Guzman
   </h3>
   <img src="main.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
   <p><font size ="5">
       The alignment Apple.com is great and organized. Everything that is in their<br> website is connected to each other and its about their products. The first thing <br>you see its their newest product which is the Iphone 7 Product Red.
       The alignment <br> is connected to each other by different size of boxes. Their
       Menu bar contains <br>all of their products and support they offer.

       </font></p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;
       Mason Rowley
   </h3>

   <p>
       The repetition that is used here can be seen in several different elements. The first is the use <br>of square shapes. The different kinds of phones can be seen with in them. They are separated <br>with a smaller stripe of white to show where one product ends and another begins. There is <br>also repetition in the way the phones are lined up. All the phones they sell are lined up the same <br>way to show case size and colors. There are also are lots colors being alternated between light <br>and dark all over the website.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;
   Blair Furner
   </h3>
   <img src="contrast.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
       The contrast in this image is very well done. The central image of the <br> watches stands out and is the first thing to catch your eye due to the <br>
       colors and unique design. Also it is very contrasted due to it being the <br> largest image on the page. The addition of the white and black contrast <br>
       adds a very simple but effective look.

   </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash;
    Vishal Peter
   </h3>
   <img src="typography.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
    The image explains the typography very well. As the big center<br> paragraph catches the attention of the people first and then the<br> explanotary one. The font size  well arranged. The other good<br> thing about this paragraph is the left handed arrangement of the<br> paragraph which keeps the reader focus.
