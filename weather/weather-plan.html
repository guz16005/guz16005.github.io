    <br>
    <h3><u>Purpose</u></h3>
    <p>
        The client would like a web based weather app created. The purpose of the site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways.<br> The initial landing page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding information given by the browser. The <br>second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a <br>search string.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Audience</u></h3>

    <p>
        Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split between mobile devices and laptops.

    </p>
    <h3><u>Audience Goals:</u></h3>
    <p>
        College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for their current location as they<br>
        head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is <br>
        important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will help with <br>
        last minute packing for road trips.
